Laboratory Activities - FastAPI

This repository contains multiple laboratory activities related to FastAPI, each focusing on a specific aspect of API development. Below is a description of each activity.

# Laboratory Activity #1: Introduction to FastAPI

This activity introduces FastAPI as a framework for building APIs. It provides a hands-on experience in creating, running, and testing APIs while reinforcing Python programming skills. The primary task is to implement an API endpoint that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. The endpoint should return false if the input is zero.

# Laboratory Activity #2: Working with HTTP Actions and API Parameters

This activity explores HTTP methods and API parameterization. The task involves creating a simple To-Do List API that supports CRUD operations using FastAPI. Participants will learn how to handle different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) and implement validation checks to ensure proper data handling. The API will return appropriate success and error messages based on the request outcomes.

# Laboratory Activity #3: Working with JSON

This activity focuses on JSON as a data format for APIs. Participants will work with JSON parsing, traversing JSON data in Python, and converting Python structures into JSON. The main task is to create an API that retrieves posts and their comments for a given user ID, demonstrating the ability to process and structure JSON data effectively. The expected output format is provided in a sample file.

# Laboratory Activity #4: Advanced API Implementation

This activity covers advanced API development concepts, including versioning, authentication, and HTTP exception handling. Participants will extend the To-Do List API from Activity #2 by implementing a second version (apiv2) alongside the original (apiv1). Additional features include improved error handling for non-existent tasks and the implementation of appropriate HTTP status codes for different API actions. Best practices for managing environment variables are also introduced.

# Laboratory Activity #5: Deploying API in Cloud

This activity focuses on deploying APIs to a cloud platform. Participants will learn how to develop and deploy their APIs to Render, ensuring that their work is accessible online. The task requires deploying Laboratory Activity #4 to Render using the provided guide.

Each folder contains the corresponding code and necessary files for its respective laboratory activity. Follow the instructions within each folder for implementation and testing.
